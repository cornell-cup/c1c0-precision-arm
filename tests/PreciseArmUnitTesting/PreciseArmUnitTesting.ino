// Unit Testing for Precise Arm without Communication with Jetson
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:

  // if move[i] = 1, assert that targetAngle[i] != current angles
  // tuple with 2 values current and future position, calculate difference to be the right direction 

}

// To do:
// 1) test each joint individually without communication
// 2) test the joints in parallel without communication
// 3) test individually with communication
// 4) test in parallel with communcaiton
